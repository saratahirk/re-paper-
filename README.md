# Re-Paper Platform 🌿

**Empowering communities through recycling and open technology.**

## 📌 Project Overview

Re-Paper is a youth- and women-led social enterprise based in Sulaimani, Iraq, that collects waste paper and transforms it into eco-friendly products such as notebooks, business cards, and labels. Our goal is to reduce environmental waste, promote sustainability, and empower women and youth by creating green job opportunities.

We are developing an open-source platform to digitize and scale our impact, using AI and data science to support smarter waste collection and community engagement.
